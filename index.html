<h4>About The List</h4>
<hr>
<p>The original Black Punk Time, which can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218011138/http://www.roctober.com/roctober/blackpunk1.html">here</a>, 
was a glorious, four-part, Web 1.0 strain on the eyes, but a Bible for Afropunks who stumbled upon it growing up in the 2010's. 
This list is and was by no means exhaustive, it's regulated to the late 70's through 80's and the last time it was updated/archived, seems to be around 2006.
<a href="https://roctober.rocks/">Roctober Magazine</a> however, is still with us, and hosts all of their issues free to read online via the great <a href="https://archive.org/details/roctobermagazine?sort=titleSorter">Archive.org.</a>
I'm only speaking for myself, but finding out that there was more Afropunk beyond Death & Bad Brains, both legends within their own right.

<h4>About The Project</h4>
<hr>
<p>I do not intend to make any kind of profit off of this, this project has been a dream of mine for years and is a labor of love.
  This is only a visual remake as opposed to a "brand new" BPT, I've had to "trim down" some entries and for the sake of brevity,
  have left out most responses from former band members, notable people who were there, which can be seen in the OG Archive linked above.
  <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAjLiBR849GubImBNtNW3v9wZ8TeUCnQ-">Here</a>, is a Youtube playlist made up of all the bands I could find on the list,
  and if you want to see more Afropunk and experimental Black music past and present, I invite you to check out my <a href="">Hyperreal Afrika</a> project.
