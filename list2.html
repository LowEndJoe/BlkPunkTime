        <h2 class="accordion-title">ADAMSON, BARRY</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Adamson, later of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, played bass in Magazine from 1979-1981. The band, while not too punk, was the product of the undeniable punk pedigree of Howard Devoto of the Buzzcocks. Adamson brought funky influence to the band, and that funkiness continued with his solo work in the 90s, especially The Negro Inside Me [Elektra, 1993], which explored his relationship with Funk, Jazz, Hip Hop and Euro Pop.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">ALDRICH, STEVE</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">The perpetually sunglassed Steve fronted the late 70s Grand Rapids, MI punk/New Wave band GWBT (which, believe it or not, stood for the Guys With Big Teeth) and then had a career spinning punk records on college radio (WSRX) which morphed into spinning "alternative" music as a pro-jock on WLAV. I've heard Aldritch's take on punk described as "possessed of a rare naivette" and also as that of "a big New Wave poseur." I suppose those aren't actually contradictory. GWBT's "Now I'm Really Mad" may be the only punk song to feature a celeste solo. (JA)

<br><br>
            Terry Mohre adds: Way off in stating that STEVE ALDRICH fronted the GUYS WITH BIG TEETH, Stig had little or nothing to do with the band except we used his drums, which I remember urinating on. Members of the GUYS WITH BIG TEETH were M. DUNG, CAPTIAN TODEL, TERRY, WALTER WRIGHT, SPUDDY, and sometimes FROOT TA MAN. Also, no celeste it was a little blue toy piano</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">ALLAH AND THE KNIFE WIELDING PUNKS</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Bernie Edwards, Nile Rogers and Tony Thompson were among the members of this 1976 co-ed New Wave act (they did not release any records) before morphing it into the legendary dance act Chic. Rogers and Edwards became two of the most successful producers in pop history, and each has worked with a number of rock artists (Rogers' collaborators include David Bowie, Peter Gabriel and Sting; Edwards' include ABC, Duran Duran and Air Supply). Edwards died of pneumonia while on tour in Japan in 1996. <br><br>Thompson also played with Duran Duran members and Robert Palmer in the Edwards-produced rock supergroup Power Station, and was the drummer for the Led Zeppelin reunion at Live Aid in 1985. He died of cancer in 2003. (JA)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">ANDERSON, RODNEY and BAPTISTE, PAT of SEISMIC WAVES</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Hailing from the wrong side of the tracks in the Chicago suburb Evanston, Rodney would go on to play drums in one of the best regional hardcore bands, DJ on the crucial punk radio show "Fast and Loud" and eventually become one of the bitterest men in Chicago punk. Seismic Waves' body of work deserve a place in punk history based on their titles alone; you have to acknowledge songs named, "Cable TV Was A Ripoff," "Lipsynch To The Go Gos," and "Fat Girls." <br><br>Guitarist Pat Baptiste was also African American, making the band 66.7% Black. The "Fast and Loud" radio show (born in 1983) was one of the cornerstones of Chicago punk. Hailing from the campus of Evanston's Northwestern University (where Rodney attended) it played a boldly diverse sampling of local, national and international punk, hardcore, Oi! and speed metal (see ZOETROPE), and the show even spawned one of the great Midwest comps, The Middle Of America. Rodney's post Seismic Waves band, 007, was a surf mod act in which he played guitar, and which featured Eric Williams, another Black rocker. (JA)</p>

        <p class="accordion-answer">Rick "Stick" Greene sang for a while with this 1980-1983 Gainesville, FL band. The Atomics for the most part were a punk/New Wave cover band.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BAD ACTOR</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Bad Actor was formed back in 1980 in Phila. Pa., original members are; Ken "Tojo" White, Henry "Tex" Mosley, Michael "Spider" Sanders (ex-Pure Hell), Gary "Wooly" Neal. Soon after forming they migrated to L.A. only to lose lead vocalist Tojo, being replaced by Shawn Bright (Oingo Boingo) and then Dee Dee Troit (U.X.A.). they played all of the then punk/new wave venues of the day, taping the very last New Wave theater, before Peter Ivers was murdered. They made only one recording that was released on the 1983 compilation LP "Sounds Of Hollywood Girl" on Doug Moody's Mystic label. Their house in Silver Lake was the meeting place for the Better Youth Organization planning the "Someone Got Their Head Kicked In" tour. Sadly Spider passed away in 2002 in the middle of reforming Pure Hell, we still miss him! See PURE HELL (Gary Neal)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BALDWIN, KENNY</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">One of the pioneers of Milwaukee punk, Baldwin was drummer in Locate Your Lips, but more significantly turned his father's strip club, Starship, into the city's first punk venue, which he managed (reportedly in a grumpy manner).</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BASEMENT 5</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Basement 5 was an all Black trio from England that combined punk, dub and Metal, with Lemmy like vocals. Their album was cryptically titled Basement 5 1965-1980 (Island, 1980) and they also had a few 45s, 12"s and EPs, including a dub mix of their album and a Christmas single, "Last White Christmas" which railed negative X-mas greetings at Jimmy Carter, Margaret Thatcher, Khomeni and Ian Smith. Their take on a punk dub fusion was much more convincing then PIL's. Leo Williams, the bass player, was later in BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE. (JA)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BEAUVIOR, JEAN</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Beauvoir's punk cred can't be denied; he played bass (and piano, and synth) for the Plasmatics from 1980-1981 (He's on Beyond the Valley Of 1984, Stiff, 1981) and he wrote the Ramones' closest thing to an '80s-style punk song (exploiting the ever popular Reagan mockery theme in "Bonzo Goes To Bitberg"). Born in Chicago to Haitian parents Beauvier took up bass early, and by his teen years was musical director for Gary "U.S." Bonds. This got him on the Dick Clark oldies circuit, which led to a stint as a singer in the Flamingos ("I Only Have Eyes For You"). Rejecting the clean-cut world of American Bandstand he started hanging on the NYC punk scene and after responding to an ad joined the Plasmatics and donned his trademark blonde Mohawk.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BIG COUNTRY</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer"> From the un-punkest reaches of the tail end of New Wave, this band did rise from the ashes of the far punker Skids. Featured one Black member, journeyman bassplayer Tony Butler (he played with the Pretenders [in 1984], Pete Townsend, and Roger Daltry, amongst others). (JA)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BLACK DEATH</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Though embraced as more of a Metal band than a punk act (their self titled 1983 LP was on the Ohio Metal label Auburn Records), Sikki Spacek and his leather-clad, all African American bandmates definitely played a Hardcore inspired brand of Thrash. The punkest thing about them was that these kids from the wrong side of the tracks (a/k/a/ East Cleveland) rode the bus to their own gigsâ€¦with guitars and a full drum kit! (JA)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BLENDERS, THE</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">This band had two Black lead singers (Bobby & Gail). I saw them open for the Bad Brains at CBGBs. No vinyl but they had a lot of fans. I also saw them at Max's. Vocalist Gail Epps is currently working as a stand up comic (edie gourmet)</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-title">BOSCH</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">This band from Columbus, OH, started as a studio project called Hieronymus Bosch for a 1977 single ("Rollin' In Firs" on local label Enigma, not the more prominent label of the same name) before emerging as a full-fledged band under the shorter name. Their promo photo shows a Black member. (JP)</p>

        <p class="accordion-answer">Bowie played bass for the Evanston, IL-based punky power pop band Front Lines. The teen was discovered in a guitar shop by the rest of the band, who were Northwestern University students (including guitarist Kier Strejcek, brother of Nathan of Teen Idles/Dischord fame. Bowie appears on both of their records, Where Do We Go From Here ep (1980, with bluesman Carey Bell guesting on harmonica) and "Capital Attraction" b/w "In This Universe (1982). </p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BOYZE, CHERYL of NASTYFACTS/PANDEMONIUM</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Boyze and her band were high school students from Brooklyn circa '79-'80, who played melodic punk and released one amazing collector scum coveted single, "Drive My Car" on Jimboco. Boyze (a/k/a Boyce) was older then the others but they asked her to be in the band (originally called Pandemonium) because she looked cool. She played bass, sang and is credited with writing the songs. They played Max's, CBGB's and even shared a bill with BAD BRAINS at a cowboy bar.</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BROWN, SHAWN of DAG NASTY</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer"> Brown, who is currently involved with Jesus Eater, performed his first show with DC melodic hardcore band Dag Nasty at the WUST Hall in DC in the early 80s. Brown recorded the band's demo, but was out of the band when they recorded their debut. He was also in Swiz and Sweetbelly Freakdown.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-title">BUS BOYS</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Time (and a still-nascent, would-be 80's revival) has totally passed this band by, and those who still remember think of them as that bar band that appeared in Eddie Murphy's 48 Hours. I'm still kinda peeved that "Make The Music Go Bang," Don Waller's excellent chronicle of the pre-MTV New Wave scene in L.A., doesn't include any Bus Boys trivia.

            <br><br>

            On their first album, Minimum Wage Rock & Roll, every other song deals with racial issues, turning negative stereotypes (old-school "yassuh, boss" Ebonics, etc.) into a vicious tool of satire. The monkeyshines were toned down on their second LP, 1982's American Worker, and then...nothing.
            
            <br><br>
            In 1988, with Black rock finally getting another shot on the radar through Living Colour, the Bus Boys reappeared on a label called Voss (related to the soft-drink company?) with the horrid Money Don't Make No Man, which had them chasing the sound of Prince but not quite catching up.

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BUZZ, NIKKI of SUN</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">With his massive afro peeking out in a goofy publicity shot Nikki Buzz, lead singer of Sun, breaks the color line on the Live At CBGB's LP (Atlantic, 1976). Listening too their track the buzzsaw guitars definitely indicate "punk" but a closer listen reveals that they're just playing 60s Blues Rock at double time. The first dead giveaway is that Nikki's vocals are straight out of the Filmore stylewise, not so much sounding like Soul vocals, but sounding like a Black take on the white 60s version of Soul vocals.</p>

  <div class="accordion">
    <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-title">BUZZ & THE FLYERS</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">This was a Black-led rockabilly band on the late '70s NY punk scene; Buzz later changed his name to Dig Wayne and sang with the band JoBoxers in 1983. He's gone into the stage and screen sides of performing in recent years. He appeared in the original London cast of the Louis Jordan musical, 5 Guys Named Moe, and showed up in a few crappy movies, including Judge Dread. (JP)</p>

        <h2 class="accordion-title">BYERS, DAVE of ENZYMES</h2>
        <p class="accordion-answer">Byers played guitar for the Washington, D.C. '80s hardcore band Enzymes, who became the punk-funk band The Psychotics. He was also in the shortlived 1981 band Peer Pressure (see TONI YOUNG), who to my knowledge didn't release any recordings but do show up a few times in the great 1988 photo book, Banned In DC. In '85 Byers was the guitarist for an early incarnation of HR's band Human Rights (also known as HR), and later played in Press Mob, a band with an ambitious take on hardcore. The first punk show he attended was the legendary Cramps show at D.C.'s Hall of Nations</p>
